For hidding 'index.php' from the URL, make sure mod_rewrite is enabled
on your Apache server. You can use the command:
# a2enmod rewrite

You can then use the provided .htaccess file at the site root directory
to redirect requests to 'index.php', so 'http://site.com/request' will
be interpreted as 'http://site.com/index.php/request'.
Make sure .htaccess files are enabled in your Apache configuration.

Finally, edit the configuration file 'application/config/config.php' and
set the property 'index_page' to blank.
